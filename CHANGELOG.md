# Changelog

All notable changes to SwiftChessTools should be documented in this file.

Entries stay under `Unreleased` until the repo is tagged or otherwise prepared
for a release.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added ChessUI move feedback for position updates made with
  `setFEN(_:animatedMove:)`:
  pieces now animate from the source square to the destination square, and the
  most recent move's source and destination squares remain highlighted.
- Added public ChessUI configuration for move feedback:
  `moveAnimationDuration`, `showsLastMoveHighlight`, `lastMoveHighlightColor`,
  `lastMoveSquares`, and `clearLastMoveHighlight()`.
- Added ChessUI smoke tests covering move-feedback state and direct FEN
  assignment behavior.
- Added ChessCore perft tests for standard reference positions, broader SAN
  parsing coverage, and focused legal-move coverage around en-passant targets.
- Added ChessUI model tests for legal-move highlighting, hints, promotion
  state, and board configuration defaults.
- Added ChessUI snapshot tests with checked-in references for board
  orientation, selection, last-move highlighting, promotion UI, and color
  schemes.
- Added a simulator-backed ChessUI XCUITest harness that drives the real board
  through tap moves, drag moves, invalid moves, promotion, black perspective,
  legal-move indicators, and last-move highlights.
- Added the macOS `ChessTest` manual driver under `Examples/ChessTest` so
  package-level UI and rules checks live with `SwiftChessTools`.

### Changed

- Renamed the primary ChessUI public board API to `ChessBoardView`,
  `ChessBoardModel`, and `ChessBoardColorScheme`.
- Renamed inherited ChessCore APIs and internals for the current package shape,
  including `FENSerializer`, `SANSerializer`, `Game.apply(move:)`, and the
  move-generation types.
- Renamed the promotion picker dismissal API to `dismissPromotionPicker()`.
- Increased the default ChessUI move animation duration to `0.45` seconds so
  longer piece moves are easier to see.
- Direct assignment to `ChessBoardModel.fen` now clears move-specific animation
  and highlight state because a raw FEN string does not identify the previous
  source square.

### Fixed

- Fixed move animation startup so SwiftUI renders the piece at the source square
  before animating it to the destination, avoiding a visual snap.
- Changed ChessUI piece rendering to use SwiftUI package asset images, avoiding
  `AsyncImage` races without introducing UIKit or AppKit dependencies.
- Fixed legal-move filtering so a non-pawn move to the current en-passant target
  square is not simulated as an en-passant capture.
